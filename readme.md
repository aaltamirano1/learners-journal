# Learner's Journal

This is a journal for anyone who is trying to learn a new skill or improve on a skill. Each journal entry requires you to provide the date, what you are currently working on, how you feel about it, and what you are looking forward to doing. It is meant to provide a helpful way to track your progress. 

You may find it especially useful and encouraging to look back on things you struggled with at some point in the past.
